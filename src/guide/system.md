# Chapter I

## Introduction
### Statement of the Problem

The current version of the TRACER has its limitations, specifically the software version. This is a very serious problem for the firewall because once the software version does not have support from the owner or developer, it will not be accessed outside SEI premises or in public. 
On the other hand, some features of the current version are not working and it is a waste of time once the scholar updates his/her profile but nothing happens.

#### General Problem

What system can be designed and developed for DOST-SEI that will hasten the  process of the encoding, updating of TRACER forms of the scholar-graduates and also the retrieval of scholar’s records, and generation of reports for data processing?

#### Specific Problem

How can we upgrade the software version of the current system? How can we make it efficient and reliable?


### Project Rationale

The use of the developed system could aid the foremost problem/s encountered by  DOST-SEI. The developed system could record the scholar’s information and upon next  update they don’t have to fill up the same form again. They just have to login and update  their current employment status. It will be easier for the side of DOST-SEI because the  fetching of data will be much easier because the data is updated real-time. There would be  fewer paper works because it is encoded online. There is also an administrator side which  can edit the content of the website using the Content Management System. The developed  system promotes effectiveness, flexibility, and reliability that could provide better service  to the scholar-graduates and realistic benefits; open useful innovation that could contribute  to the development of the DOST-SEI tracking of scholars. 

### Objectives

#### General Objective

The developer aims to develop and upgrade the current online tracking system for the benefit of the  scholar-graduate and also the DOST-SEI. As for the DOST-SEI, the staff will not waste time on encoding the TRACER forms when the scholar-graduates can encode it online. For  the scholar-graduates, the system will serve as an online portal where they can update  their current info without needing to accomplish long forms again and again yearly.

##### Specific Objectives
1. To develop new features and upgrade current version of the  system that would record scholar-graduate’s data real-time anywhere  around the world. 
2. To develop a system that would provide real-time data which will be needed for  data processing. 


##### Scope

1. The system will automatically save the data of the scholar-graduates to the  Research database. 
2. The system will have a structured database for the benefit of data processing. 
3. Scholar-graduates can easily update their information anytime or anywhere they  want. 
4. The data is accessible by the DOST-SEI real-time. 

##### Limitations
1. The system will not be running outside DOST-SEI premises once the support for the current used version has ended because of the firewall restriction.
2. The system is limited to connecting the Scholar’s data to the Scholarship database  and system. Thus, there is no means of verification. 
3. The system cannot display graphs because the data needs to be verified first.
4. The system cannot display graphs because the data needs to be verified first.
