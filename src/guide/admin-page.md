# Administration Page

In this section, you can control by adding, updating, and deleting all items shown in the scholar's view. In other words, this page is your Content Management System (CMS).

For an instance, you are going to inform all scholars that there is an Alumni Homecoming this year and all scholars are obliged to join, you can create a post and state all information needed to that event. Specify what type of post is it and you can then publish it to inform everybody. You can use the Email Blast if you want all scholars to receive the info via email.
