# Chapter III

## The SEI-TRACER Project Version 2.0

### Introduction

The SEI-TRACER Project Version 2.0 was developed to improve the current system. The general design specifications are discussed theories of database  design, and process specifications. These theories are discussed and illustrated using the  Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), The Data-Flow Diagrams and the Hierarchical  Input-Process-Output Diagrams. This chapter discussed how the entire system worked and its functionalities, with relation to each module present in it. 

### System Design and Specifications

The following is the list of devices and software used by the developer in the  development of the system. 

#### Text Editor

A text editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store, and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users or to other programs). Typically, a text editor provides an "empty" display screen (or "scrollable page") with a fixed-line length and visible line numbers. You can then fill the lines in with text, line by line. A special command line lets you move to a new page, scroll forward or backward, make global changes in the document, save the document, and perform other actions. After saving a document, you can then print it or display it. Before printing or displaying it, you may be able to format it for some specific output device or class of output device. Text editors can be used to enter program language source statements or to create documents such as technical manuals [https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/text-editor].

#### PHP Version

PHP is an open-source programming language that runs on a webserver. It is one of the most popular languages for web development; for example, all Laravel, Joomla or WordPress sites run on PHP. PHP is a server-side script, meaning that it is executed on the webserver, contrary to HTML, which is executed in the browser

The developer used the PHP version 8.1 because it has a lot of good features on it. Aside from that, it is very fast compared to old versions.

#### Server & Framework

##### Laravel ^8.75 (Backend)

The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. All of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.

However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

* PHP >= 7.2.5
* BCMath PHP Extension
* Ctype PHP Extension
* Fileinfo PHP extension
* JSON PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension

##### Quasar Framework ^2.0.0 (Frontend)

Quasar Framework is an open-source Vue.js based framework for building apps, with a single codebase, and deploy it on the Web as a SPA, PWA, SSR, to a Mobile App, using Cordova for iOS & Android, and to a Desktop App, using Electron for Mac, Windows, and Linux [Wikipedia].

##### NodeJS ^16.16

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications [Wekipedia].
