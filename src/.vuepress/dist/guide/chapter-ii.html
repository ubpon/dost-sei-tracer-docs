The developer observed different theories that were applied in the  system. The theories below served as a current basis for the developer’s research, and this  is pertinent in solving the attainable set objectives of this study, to map out the scopes of  the study, and to provide the limitations of the study. Adapted in the development of the  system, and its fundamental principles these theories served and created a huge effect on  the development of the system. The said theories will be discussed below.</p> <h4 id="non-it-concepts"><a href="#non-it-concepts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Non-IT Concepts</h4> <h4 id="monitoring-system"><a href="#monitoring-system" class="header-anchor">#</a> Monitoring System</h4> <p>Monitoring systems are devices that automatically monitor measurements in critical  care and specialty areas and a process whereby the programmatic and business  management performance aspects of a grant are viewed by accessing information gathered  from various reports, audits, site visits, and other sources. [TRACER V1]</p> <p>A program that observes, supervises, or controls the activities of other programs. It  can be in the form of an electronic device used to record, regulate, or control a process, or task  of a certain program. [TRACER V1]</p> <h4 id="it-concepts"><a href="#it-concepts" class="header-anchor">#</a> IT Concepts</h4> <h5 id="database-management-theory"><a href="#database-management-theory" class="header-anchor">#</a> Database Management Theory</h5> <p>The database is a systematic collection of data. Databases support storage and  manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy. It is an intermediate link  between the physical database, computer and the operating system and the users. The heart  of a database is the database management system (DBMS), which allows the creation,  modification, and updating of the database; the retrieval of data; and the generation of  reports and displays.<br>
Database Management System is a collection of programs which enables its users  to access databases, manipulate data, representation of data. It is a software package that  carries out many different tasks including the provision of facilities to enable the user to  access and modify information in the database. To provide the various facilities to different  types of users, a DBMS normally provides one or more specialized programming  languages called database languages. [TRACER V1]</p> <h5 id="database-normalization"><a href="#database-normalization" class="header-anchor">#</a> Database Normalization</h5> <p>Database Normalization is a database design technique which organizes tables in a  manner that reduces redundancy and dependency of data. It divides larger tables to  smaller tables and link them using relationships. The inventor of the relational  model Edgar Codd proposed the theory of normalization with the introduction of First
Normal Form and he continued to extend theory with Second and Third Normal  Form. Later he joined with Raymond F. Boyce to develop the theory of Boyce-Codd  Normal Form. [TRACER V1]</p> <h5 id="data-flow-diagram"><a href="#data-flow-diagram" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Flow Diagram</h5> <p>The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the flow of data  through an information system. It enables you to represent the processes in your  information system from the viewpoint of data. The DFD lets you visualize how the system  operates, what the system accomplishes and how it will be implemented, when it is refined  with further specification.
Data flow diagrams are used by systems analysts to design information-processing  systems but also as a way to model whole organizations. You build a DFD at the very  beginning of your business process modeling in order to model the functions your system  has to carry out and the interaction between those functions together with focusing on data  exchanges between processes. You can associate data with conceptual, logical, and  physical data models and object-oriented models. [TRACER V1]</p> <h4 id="entity-relationship-diagram"><a href="#entity-relationship-diagram" class="header-anchor">#</a> Entity Relationship Diagram</h4> <p>An Entity Relationship Diagram is a model that identifies the concepts or entities  that exist in a system and the relationships between those entities. An ERD is often used  as a way to visualize a relational database: each entity represents a database table, and the  relationship lines represent the keys in one table that point to specific records in related  tables. ERDs may also be more abstract, not necessarily capturing every table needed  within a database, but serving to diagram the major concepts and relationships. The  entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a data model or diagram for high-level description  of conceptual data model, and it provides a graphical notation for representing such data  models in the form of entity-relationship diagrams. ERD facilitates database design by  allowing the specification of an “enterprise schema” which represents the overall logical  structure of a database. [ZEEP2012].</p> <h3 id="summary"><a href="#summary" class="header-anchor">#</a> Summary</h3> <p>The IT and Non-IT Concepts discussed above were all relevant in the development  of the system. The IT Concepts that were considered can help the developer provide  relevant information from necessary data stored in the database. The said database is  designed for proper management of data. Database Normalization was also discussed  wherein the developer should eliminate data redundancy for more accurate date and less  space consumed. The entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a data model or diagram for  high-level description of conceptual data model, and it provides a graphical notation for  representing such data models in the form of entity-relationship diagrams.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Non-IT Concepts were also considered to help the developer  create a system that could be easily used by the end users without requiring them to have  in depth knowledge on technical skills. These considerations also let the developer realize  that the system should be as convenient as possible for the end users.</p> <p>All the above discussions show the necessary considerations for the developer to  provide a system that would meet the requirements of the DOST-SEI. These ideas helped  in the development of the system because its serves as references for the developer to  ensure the relativity of the system processes to the IT and Non-IT Concepts.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
